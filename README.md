# fizzbuzz
I thought it would be fun to implement something in as many languages as possible. Fizz buzz is a simple maths game where every number that can be divided by three gets replaced by the word "Fizz", every number that can be divided by five who gets replaced by the work "Buzz", and every number that's divisible by both gets "Fizz Buzz".

The spec for any of these short programs is to write the "fizzbuzz" of the first 100 positive integers to console. Simple enough.
